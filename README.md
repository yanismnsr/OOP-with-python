simulation of a world of zones contaning people and calculate average agreeableness of each zone (openclassrooms project)

### steps

simulation of 100000 virtual persons with differents specefities from that website : http://pplapi.com/  
among those specifities, there's position defined by latitud and longitud  
I created a kind of a big zone wich is earth, that contains sub-zones  
With those objects, we can now determinate to wich sub-zone belongs each person (agent object)  
  
An other specifity of each agent : agreeableness  
In the end of my project, I did a graph wich gives us informations about average agreeableness of each sub-zone  
  
hope you appreciate my work.
